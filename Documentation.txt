### Overview
Dijkstra-C provides an implementation of Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm in C. Here are the key functions related to the algorithm:

1. **`minDistance(int dist[], int visited[])`**:
   - Purpose: Finds the vertex with the minimum distance value.
   - Parameters:
     - `dist[]`: An array storing the shortest distances from the source.
     - `visited[]`: An array marking visited vertices.
   - Returns: The index of the vertex with the minimum distance.

2. **`printPath(int parent[], int j)`**:
   - Purpose: Recursively prints the shortest path from the source to a target vertex.
   - Parameters:
     - `parent[]`: An array storing parent vertices for each vertex.
     - `j`: The target vertex.
   - Returns: Nothing (void function).

3. **`dijkstra(int graph[V][V], int src)`**:
   - Purpose: Performs Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest paths.
   - Parameters:
     - `graph[V][V]`: The adjacency matrix representing the graph.
     - `src`: The source vertex.
   - Details:
     - Initializes distance values and parent vertices.
     - Iterates through vertices to find the shortest paths.
     - Updates distances and parent vertices as needed.
     - Prints the results (distances and paths).
